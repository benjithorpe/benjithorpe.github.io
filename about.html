					<!-- who I am and what I'm doing -->
					<p>
						I consider myself a <q>forever student</q>, eager to build on my academic foundations and try to
						stay in tune with latest technology conventions through the tech communities, articles and practice.
					</p>
					
					<!-- my future goals -->
					<p>
						I am determined to learn and understand everything I can about technology. My aim is to 
						be a very good <b>Back-end Engineer/Developer</b> and hopefully someday a <b>Cloud Engineer</b>.

				<!-- how I got here, interests and how am helping -->
				<p>
					I have been in the learning process since I developed passion for programming in high school 
					and have been involved in some tech communities for the past 10 months.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, my interests goes beyond tech. I love fiction, tech movies, chess <i>(but can't play)</i>.
					I also love listening to advice, success stories, guides and tips from people on every aspect of life.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also try my best to help others by sharing good articles, tutorials, books and 
					helpful methods/skills used by many developers.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>I believe that determination, passion, hard work and learning from others are the key to success.</b>
