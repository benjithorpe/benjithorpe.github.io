					<p class="lead">My name is <b>Benjamin I. Thorpe</b>.
					I consider myself as <b>a <q>forever student</q></b>, eager to build on my academic foundations and stay in tune with the latest technology conventions through coursework, articles, practice.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">I am determined to understand and learn everything I can about tech. My aim is to become a <b>Back-end Engineer/Developer, Systems Architecture, Sys Admin, a <abbr title="Certified Ethical Hacker">C.E.H</abbr></b>, and many more I haven't discovered yet.</p>

				<div> <!-- how I got here -->
					<p>My hunger for knowledge and my determination to turn information into action has contributed to my most recent success, building my portfolio website. Which I am always updating using the feedback I get from mentors, colleagues and other developers.</p>

					<p>I also try to ease the learning process of my coursemates and friends by sharing good articles, tutorials, books and helpful methods/skills used by many developers. I believe that determination, passion, hard work and learning from others are the key to success.</p>

					<p> However, my interests extend beyond the web and tech, I love music, movies, fictions and solving puzzles. I also love hearing advice, stories, guides and tips on every aspect of life from experienced people.</p>

				<div> <!-- where I am looking to go next -->
					<p>I've been in the process of learning since I developed passion and curiousity for programming in High school and have been actively involved in the Web Development &amp; Python communities for the past 7 months.</p>

					<p>I have worked on some basic programs and projects while learning and that has helped me understand and grasp many concepts. When I'm not developing, I'm probably hanging out with my friends, reading articles, watching movies or something inspirational.</p>
