					<p>My name is <b>Benjamin I. Thorpe</b>.
					I am fueled by my determination and curiosity to understand and learn everything I can about technology. I consider myself as a <q>forever student</q>, eager to build on my academic foundations in Software Engineering and stay in tune with the latest technology conventions through coursework, articles, podcasts, etc.</p>

				<div class="how"> <!-- how I got here -->
					<p>My hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to my most recent success, creating my portfolio website. Which I am always updating using the feedback from mentors, colleagues and other developers.
					Meanwhile, I also help ease the learning process of my coursemates and friends by sharing good articles, tutorials, books and helpful methods/skills used by many developers I admire, and ensuring an easy roadmap for them. I believe that determination, passion, hard work and learning from others are the key to success. 
					My interests, however, extend beyond the web, I love music, reading fictions and solving puzzles. I love hearing advice, stories, and tips from experienced people and that has help pass on my knowledge to others.</p>

				<div class="where"> <!-- where I am looking to go next -->
					<p>I've been in the process of learning about technology since I developed passion and curiousity for programming while in high school. After enrolling in BlueCrest University College of Sierra Leone, I've been actively involved in the web development &amp; python communities for the past 6 months.
				 	I've developed programs like, an insecure 
				 	<a href="https://github.com/benjithorpe/exercise-projects/blob/master/al/pw.py">password locker</a>, a 
				 	<a href="https://github.com/benjithorpe/exercise-projects/blob/master/hyperskill/zookeeper.py">zookeeping</a> program, a <a href="https://github.com/benjithorpe/exercise-projects/blob/master/al/bulletPointAdder.py">bullet point adder</a> and others while learning. 
				 	When I'm not developing, I'm probably hanging out with my friends, reading articles, watching movies, playing games or watching something inspired by people.
				 	I'm always interested in a challenge. Reach out to connect!</p>
