				<div> <!-- how I got here and how am helping -->
					<p>I've been in the process of learning since I developed passion and curiousity for programming in High school and have been actively involved in the Web Development &amp; Python communities for the past 7 months.</p>

					<p>I also try to ease the learning process of my coursemates and friends by sharing good articles, tutorials, books and helpful methods/skills used by many developers.
					I believe that determination, passion, hard work and learning from others are the key to success.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section>
				<div>
					<p>I have worked on some basic programs and projects while learning and that has helped me understand and grasp many concepts.
					When I'm not developing, I'm probably hanging out with my friends, reading articles, watching movies or something inspirational.
					I'm always interested in a challenge.
