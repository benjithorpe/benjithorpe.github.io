					I consider myself as a <q>forever student</q>, eager to build on my academic foundations and stay in tune with the latest technology conventions through coursework, articles, practice. I am determined to understand and learn everything I can about tech.</p>

				<div class="how"> <!-- how I got here -->
					<p>My hunger for knowledge and my determination to turn information into action has contributed to my most recent success, building my portfolio website. Which I am always updating using the feedback I get from mentors, colleagues and other developers.
					I also help ease the learning process of my coursemates and friends by sharing good articles, tutorials, books and helpful methods/skills used by many developers I admire, to ensure an easy roadmap for them. I believe that determination, passion, hard work and learning from others are the key to success.
					My interests, however, extend beyond the web and tech, I love music, reading fictions and solving puzzles. I love hearing advice, stories, and tips on every aspect of life from experienced people and that has helped me understand and learn many things.</p>

				<div class="where"> <!-- where I am looking to go next -->
					<p>I've been in the process of learning since I developed passion and curiousity for programming in high school. After enrolling in BlueCrest University College of Sierra Leone, I've been actively involved in the web development &amp; python communities for the past 7 months. I've developed some basic programs which has helped me learn and apply my knowledge in some projects.
				 	When I'm not developing, I'm probably hanging out with my friends, reading articles, watching movies or something inspirational.
				 	I'm always interested in a challenge. Reach out to connect!</p>
