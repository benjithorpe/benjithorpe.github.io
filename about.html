				<div> <!-- how I got here, interests and how am helping -->
					<p>I have been in the learning process since I developed passion for programming in high school 
						and have been involved in many tech communities for the past 9 months.
					</p>

					<p> However, my interests goes beyond tech. I love fictional stories, tech movies, chess <i>(but can't play)</i>.
						I also love listening to advice, stories, guides and tips from experienced people on every aspect of life.
					</p>

					<p>I also try my best to help others by sharing good articles, tutorials, books and 
						helpful methods/skills used by many developers.
						I believe that determination, passion, hard work and learning from others are the key to success.
