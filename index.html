				<p>
					I am a student and an aspiring Software Engineer/Developer. I am fasicinated by how tech is evolving and helping in our daily lives. <br>
					I have always been curious of how tech works under the hood. During <em>high school</em> days <em>hacking and creating my own apps</em> was my biggest motivation and inspiration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Back then, using a computer was all about playing movies, games, reading and using <em>MS Paint</em> because I loved drawing.
					Then during some research (on how to hack and how I can make my own apps), I came to realize I had a passion for programming. <br>
					I dived more and I found out that I can make more than games, and even build my own website (and any website I want), the first basic <em>HTML</em> I wrote was super fun for me, I felt like a genius and honestly I can proudly say it's my addiction now!.

			<h3>What I Do</h3>
			<div class="skills">
				<p>
					Currently I'm learning <strong>Python and web developement</strong> <em>(self-taught)</em> and I build basic web scrapers. <br>
					I hope to work as a back-end developer/software engineer in a company or as a freelancer someday. <br>
					I love to hear advice, stories, and learn from experience people and help teach others what I already know.
